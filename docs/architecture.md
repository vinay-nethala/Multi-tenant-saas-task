# 🏗️ System Architecture – Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

## 📌 Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the **Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform**, explaining how frontend, backend, database, authentication, and deployment layers work together to deliver a scalable and secure system.

---

## 🎯 Architecture Goals

* Support **multi-tenancy** with data isolation
* Ensure **scalability and maintainability**
* Provide **secure authentication & authorization**
* Enable **containerized deployment** using Docker

---

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture

```
Client (Browser)
      ↓
React Frontend (SPA)
      ↓ REST API
Node.js Backend (Express)
      ↓ ORM (Prisma)
PostgreSQL Database
```

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Architecture

**Technology:** React.js

### Responsibilities

* User authentication (Login / Register)
* Role-based dashboards (Super Admin, Admin, User)
* Task & project management UI
* API communication with backend

### Key Components

* `pages/` – Login, Register, Dashboard
* `context/` – Auth & Global State
* `services/` – API calls (Axios)
* `components/` – Reusable UI elements

✔ Stateless UI with controlled forms
✔ Environment-based API configuration

---

## ⚙️ Backend Architecture

**Technology:** Node.js + Express

### Responsibilities

* Authentication & authorization (JWT)
* Multi-tenant request handling
* Business logic for users, tenants, tasks
* API validation & error handling

### Key Layers

* **Routes** – API endpoints
* **Controllers** – Request handling
* **Services** – Business logic
* **Middleware** – Auth, role checks

✔ Stateless RESTful APIs
✔ Secure role-based access control

---

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

**Technology:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM

### Core Tables

* `tenants` – Workspace information
* `users` – Tenant-based users
* `tasks` – Task management
* `projects` – Optional grouping

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy

* **Tenant ID–based isolation**
* Composite unique constraints
* Indexed foreign keys

✔ Prevents cross-tenant data access
✔ Supports scalability

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT-based authentication
* Password hashing using bcrypt
* Role-based access control:

  * Super Admin
  * Tenant Admin
  * User

✔ Secure token validation middleware
✔ Protected API routes

---

## 🐳 Deployment Architecture

**Technology:** Docker & Docker Compose

### Containers

* Frontend container
* Backend container
* PostgreSQL database container

### Benefits

* Environment consistency
* Easy local & production deployment
* Isolated services

✔ One-command startup
✔ Easy rebuild and scaling

---

## 🔁 Request Flow Example

1. User logs in via frontend
2. Frontend sends request to backend API
3. Backend validates JWT & tenant
4. Prisma queries tenant-specific data
5. Response sent back to UI

---

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

* Stateless backend services
* Database indexing
* Container-based scaling
* Ready for cloud deployment (AWS / Azure)

---

## ✅ Summary

The architecture follows **industry best practices** for modern SaaS platforms, ensuring security, scalability, and clean separation of concerns while remaining simple and easy to understand for evaluation.
